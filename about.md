After graduating in June 2013 from Williams College with degrees in Computer Science and Geoscience, I moved across the country to Seattle to begin work with Microsoft on the SQL Azure DB team.

After 2 years at Microsoft, I moved to the San Francisco area to work at Strava, the social network for athletes. I've been there the past 5 years doing Android Development, Full Stack development, and most recently serving as the Engineering Manager for the Summit Team, responsible for building our paid features and maintaining our payment infrastructure.

Outside of work, I enjoy spending my time outdoors. Between my passions for running, rock climbing, mountain biking, and hiking, I like to keep myself pretty busy. I also developed a love for travel pretty early as my parents purchased a motorhome and decided that our family should tour the country. These travels are chronicled at [cross-country-trips.com](http://www.cross-country-trips.com).

A copy of my current resume can be found [here](/Resources/GaidusResume.pdf).
