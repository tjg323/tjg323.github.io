After graduating in June 2013 from Williams College with degrees in Computer Science and Geoscience, I moved across the country to Seattle to begin work with Microsoft on the SQL Azure DB team.

Outside of work, I enjoy spending my time outdoors. Between my passions for running, rock climbing, mountain biking, and hiking, I like to keep myself pretty busy. I also developed a love for travel pretty early as my parents purchased a motorhome and decided that our family should tour the country. Over the last 11 years, we have visited over 60 national parks and as of last spring, all 50 states. These travels are chronicled at cross-country-trips.com.

Professionally, I spent time working for App-X in Broomfield, Colorado; a company providing web-based software for Alternative Asset Fund Managers. Through my work with their AIM and Pulse products, I have developed valuable experience with the Salesforce platform and more generally, the process of releasing and maintaining commercial software products. During the school year, while working part-time, the remote development I do teaches different, yet equally important development skills. In August 2013, I began work at Microsoft as a Software Development Engineer on the SQL Azure DB team. My work is focused on monitoring and cluster exhaust.
