After graduating in June 2013 from Williams College with degrees in Computer Science and Geoscience, I moved across the country to Seattle to begin work with Microsoft on the SQL Azure DB team.

Outside of work, I enjoy spending my time outdoors. Between my passions for running, rock climbing, mountain biking, and hiking, I like to keep myself pretty busy. I also developed a love for travel pretty early as my parents purchased a motorhome and decided that our family should tour the country. These travels are chronicled at [cross-country-trips.com](http://www.cross-country-trips.com).
